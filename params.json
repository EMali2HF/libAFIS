{"name":"libAFIS","tagline":"SourceAFIS -> C","body":"### Summary\r\nSourceAFIS is currently the best open-source automatic fingerprint identification system (AFIS) available. However the main implementation is written in C# with a focus on the .NET framework. To make SourceAFIS faster and more versatile SimPrints and RedGate (A.K.A SimGate) is creating an open source port of the code base in C called libAFIS. Being in C this version will be platform independent allowing it to run on almost any device, from embedded targets to Android.  This will enable mobile health to reach millions of people around the world.\r\n\r\n### Readme\r\nCheckout the readme for more info [here](https://github.com/SimPrints/libAFIS/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail [simprints](mailto:info@simprints.com) for support info.\r\n","google":"UA-68291920-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
